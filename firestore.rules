/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for İstedad Mərkəzi Platform.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for student data (profiles, projects, achievements, certificates).
 * Organizations and talent categories are separate top-level collections with distinct access control.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{studentId}: Stores student profile data.  'studentId' MUST match the authenticated user's UID.
 * - /users/{studentId}/projects/{projectId}: Stores project data owned by the student. 'studentId' is denormalized for authorization.
 * - /users/{studentId}/achievements/{achievementId}: Stores achievement data owned by the student. 'studentId' is denormalized for authorization.
 * - /users/{studentId}/certificates/{certificateId}: Stores certificate data owned by the student. 'studentId' is denormalized for authorization.
 * - /organizations/{organizationId}: Stores organization profile data.
 * - /categories/{categoryId}: Stores talent category data.
 * - /faculties/{facultyId}: Stores faculty data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Students can only create, update, and delete their own profile data and associated subcollections.
 * - All users (authenticated or not) can read and list student profiles to enable search and ranking features.
 * - Organizations can create, read, update, and delete their own profiles.
 * - Categories and Faculties are publicly readable. Writes are not defined in the schema, defaulting to deny all.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The 'studentId' field is denormalized into the Project, Achievement, and Certificate documents. This allows security rules
 * on these documents to directly verify ownership without needing to perform additional `get()` operations.
